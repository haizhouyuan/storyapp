# SSH port forwarding for Codex login (2025-09-18 11:07Z)

_**User (2025-09-18 10:51Z)**_

明白，你的环境是 飞牛 FNOS + SSH + 内网穿透。要解决 Codex 登录后“浏览器回调到本地 localhost:1455，却回不去远程 NAS”的问题，用 SSH 本地端口转发最稳。下面给你一套一步到位的操作流程（含常见坑位排查），以及两种备选方案（curl 回填回调URL、API Key登录）。

✅ 首选方案：用 SSH 把本地 1455 映射到远程 127.0.0.1:1455

原理：让你本机浏览器里的 http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?... 通过 SSH 隧道转发到远程 NAS 上 Codex CLI 正在监听的回调服务。

官方文档确认 Codex CLI 首次运行会要求认证，推荐“Sign in with ChatGPT”；也支持用 API Key（需额外配置）。

社区帖子也明确过：有用户登录后浏览器重定向到 loopback localhost:1455，如果本地没监听就会失败（这正是你遇到的现象）。
OpenAI Community

操作步骤

下面命令中，用你的实际主机名/IP、SSH 端口、用户名替换尖括号内容。你是内网穿透已打通 SSH，所以 -L 转发可以直接用。

在你本机（macOS/Linux/Windows PowerShell 均可）开一条隧道：

# 如 SSH 端口是 22：
ssh -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>

# 如果你的 SSH 是通过穿透映射到非 22 端口（举例 60022）：
# ssh -NT -p 60022 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>


-N 不执行远程命令、-T 可选禁用 TTY、-L 建立本地→远程的端口转发。

ExitOnForwardFailure=yes 能在端口占用或转发失败时立即报错退出，避免“看起来连上了其实没转发”。

在远程 NAS（另开一个 SSH 会话）启动登录：

codex   # 或 codex login


它会输出一条以 https://auth.openai.com/oauth/... 开头的登录链接。

在本机浏览器打开上一步链接 → 完成登录
完成后浏览器会重定向到 http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?...，此时回调将经你刚才的 SSH 隧道送达 远程 NAS 的 127.0.0.1:1455，Codex CLI 当场完成认证。

自检（可选）

NAS 端确认回调端口在监听（FNOS 是 Linux，二选一）：

ss -ltnp | grep :1455  ||  netstat -tnlp | grep :1455


本机确认隧道通了（浏览器不一定显示页面，HTTP/1.1 404 也说明隧道通了）：

curl -I http://localhost:1455/ || true

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking tunneling setup**

I’m looking into adding `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` to keep the tunnel alive. It’s good to be aware of common pitfalls like port usage and the “127.0.0.1 only binding,” which ensures it’s loopback. 

For checking commands, I’ll include `ss -ltnp | grep :1455` and `netstat`. Also, I’ll mention using `autossh` for keeping things alive with the command `autossh -M 0 -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 user@host`. 

I’ll provide guidance on using jump hosts and testing with `python3 -m http.server 1455`.
**Crafting a concise answer in Chinese**

I’ll create a brief answer in Chinese with clear headings. 

The sections will include:  
- 简要确认  
- 步骤（精简）  
- 常见坑位/排查清单  
- 备选方案 A、B  
- 可选增强：autossh 保活、端口冲突  

I’ll mention NAT port mapping too, especially if the remote is only accessible via 127.0.0.1, which is correct for using `-L` with that address. 

I’ll make sure to use markdown headings, bullet lists, and code fences. I want to keep the formatting minimal and functional. It might also be helpful to advise testing with `curl -v` for wrong host mapping issues.
**Streamlining instructions and commands**

The "developer" instruction mentions using "status_update_spec" for tool usage, but since I won't be using any tools, I can skip micro-updates. Instead, I’ll focus on delivering a clear summary at the end, but I might skip it for basic queries.

I’ll verify commands like `curl -I http://localhost:1455/ | true`, along with noting that if the port 1455 is blocked by a corporate network, it’s likely not an issue since it's set to loopback. I could also mention binding local interfaces with `-L 127.0.0.1:1455:127.0.0.1:1455`, but I want to keep it simple.
**Confirming and streamlining steps**

I want to ensure I don’t include bare URLs, and if I mention OpenAI docs, I won’t link them either. Now, to craft the final message with the title: 确认与精简步骤.

First, I’ll provide the commands: 

1. To create a tunnel on your local machine, use:  
   ```
   ssh -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>
   ```
   If you need to specify a port, add `-p 60022`. 

2. Start `codex` with: `codex` or `codex login`. 

3. In your local browser, open the link that redirects to: `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?...`. 

4. Verify the connection with:
   - Remote: `ss -ltnp | grep :1455 || netstat -tnlp | grep :1455`
   - Local: `curl -I http://localhost:1455/ || true`.

Then, I’ll note some common issues, like if local port 1455 is occupied, you can check with `lsof -i :1455` or `ss -ltnp | grep 1455`. If it’s in use, I could suggest choosing another port mapping, but remember the callback must always direct to 1455 for the browser to connect properly.
**Providing clear instructions and options**

I realize we can't choose a different local port, so it’s best to instruct the user to free up port 1455. They can do this with `sudo fuser -k 1455/tcp` or by killing the process occupying it.

For SSH with NAT mapping, I'd suggest using `-J` for ProxyCommand or a Jump host. If they’re running the Codex CLI in a container, they can either run it directly on the host or map the container port with something like `docker run --network=host` or `-p 127.0.0.1:1455:1455`. 

For multiple logins, be aware they might face "state mismatch" issues due to restarts. 

As an alternative, they can manually fill in the callback URL steps that include logging in through NAS, copying the redirected link, and checking success with CLI commands or sharing via an ephemeral file. 

They could also set up the API key on NAS using `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."` and optionally include the base URL. 

For maintaining connection, `autossh -M 0 ...` might be helpful. 

Finally, to clean up, they can just use ctrl+C. I'll keep this simple and to the point!</details></think>

### 结论
你的方案是对的：用 SSH 本地端口转发把浏览器的 `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?...` 隧道到 NAS 上 `127.0.0.1:1455`，Codex CLI 就能当场完成认证。下面给你一版精简可执行步骤、常见坑排查，以及两种备选方案。

### 一步到位操作
1) 在你本机开隧道（端口必须是 1455）
```bash
# 端口 22
ssh -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>

# 若 SSH 非 22 端口（例 60022）
ssh -NT -p 60022 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>
```

2) 在 NAS（另一个 SSH 会话）启动登录
```bash
codex   # 或
codex login
```
复制它输出的登录链接（以 `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/...` 开头）。

3) 在你本机浏览器打开链接完成登录  
浏览器会重定向到 `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?...`，回调会通过隧道送达 NAS 的 `127.0.0.1:1455`，CLI 完成认证。

### 自检（可选）
- 在 NAS 看 1455 是否在监听：
```bash
ss -ltnp | grep :1455  ||  netstat -tnlp | grep :1455
```
- 在你本机确认隧道可达（出现 200/302/404 皆表明隧道已通）：
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:1455/ || true
```

### 常见坑与排查
- 本机 1455 被占用：必须释放（浏览器固定回调到 1455，不能改本地端口）。
  - mac/Linux: `lsof -i :1455` 或 `ss -ltnp | grep :1455` 查占用进程后结束之。
- 隧道未真正建立：加 `-o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes` 能立即失败退出；必要时加 `-v` 查看详情。
- 跳板/代理环境：如需跳板，增加 `-J <jump_user>@<jump_host>`。
- Codex 在容器里跑：确保容器把 1455 暴露到宿主回环口，例如：
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:1455:1455 <codex-image> codex
```
或直接在宿主运行 `codex` 最省事。
- 回调 state 失配：重新执行 `codex login` 获取新链接，全新走一遍。

### 备选方案 A：不用隧道，手动回填回调 URL
- NAS 执行 `codex`（或 `codex login`）得到登录链接。
- 你本机浏览器登录后，复制最终重定向到的完整回调 URL（形如 `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?code=...&state=...`）。
- 在 NAS 直接回填给本地回调服务：
```bash
curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback?code=...&state=..." -o /dev/null -D -
```
CLI 会收到回调并完成认证。

### 备选方案 B：API Key 登录（不走浏览器）
- 在 NAS 设置环境变量后直接使用：
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxx..."
# 如需自定义基址再设：
# export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"

codex   # 或 codex <你的命令>
```
说明：多数 CLI 会优先读取 `OPENAI_API_KEY`，无需浏览器授权。

### 可选增强（保活隧道）
需要长时间保持隧道可用时：
```bash
autossh -M 0 -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 1455:127.0.0.1:1455 <user>@<nas_host_or_ip>
```

- 关闭隧道：在开隧道的终端按 Ctrl+C。

- 你现在可以直接照以上步骤执行；如遇具体报错，把命令输出贴过来，我帮你快速定位。

你为我执行方案A，你现在就是在ssh连接的这台nas上了

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering tool calls**

I think we should simplify things by running a parallel step after a short delay to parse the entire file. The tool call is single, but the dev instructions suggest maximizing parallel tool calls. So, I could run two commands in parallel: first, start the codex login in the background with redirect, then, after 2 seconds, parse the file for a URL and check if the port is listening. However, I realize that running parsing before starting the process would fail, so I’ll have them offset and run them sequentially.
**Planning the process**

I think the better approach is to start the process and then run a command to tail the log while extracting the URL using `grep -m1 -o 'https://[^ ]*'` and print it. I realize I can implement a "block until URL appears" feature with `grep -m1`, but that might hang for a bit. I'll set a moderate timeout instead. Plus, I should provide a minimal status update before the tool calls, so I'll create a to-do list first with `todo_write`.
**Executing the plan**

I'm ready to proceed, starting with a status update: "我现在在 NAS 上开始执行方案A，先启动 codex login 获取登录链接。" Next, I need to create a to-do list and mark the first task as in progress.

For the terminal command, I'll run a bash command to clean up any previous logs and start the `codex login` process. I realize I need to keep the background process and echo the PID in the same shell instead of using a subshell, since `$!` won't work as intended otherwise. No parentheses!
**Executing the command**

I'm going to run the command to clean up existing logs and start the `codex login` process. After that, I’ll attempt to extract the URL from the log file, but I realize it might not be formatted as I expect. I should check for the presence of `codex` in the PATH first with `command -v codex`. If it’s missing, I’ll need to inform the user and suggest installation steps, like using `npm i -g @openai/codex` or `pip install openai-codex`. It's important to keep going!
**Finalizing the setup and commands**

I realize "Codex" as "OpenAI CodeX CLI" isn't a known package; it might refer to "Cursor's Codex." To be safe, I’ll check if `codex` exists by running `command -v codex` first. If it's missing, I’ll provide an appropriate error message. I need to ensure the CLI commands are set up correctly.

After creating tasks, I'll run a command to start the `codex login`, handle any issues with the login link, and prepare to guide the user on how to proceed after logging in. I also plan to give a status update: "我在NAS上启动了 codex login，在后台等待回调，并抓取登录链接。" Let's implement the command sequence and check for callbacks!</details></think>

我现在在 NAS 上执行方案A：先启动 codex 登录流程并抓取登录链接，然后等你在本机浏览器完成登录后给我最终回调URL，我再在NAS上回填该URL完成认证。现在开始启动登录并提取链接。

---

## Todo List

- [-] 启动 codex login 生成登录链接
- [ ] 等待用户在本机完成登录并提供回调URL
- [ ] 在NAS回填回调URL到本地回调服务
- [ ] 验证认证是否成功并清理临时文件

---

我先在NAS上启动 codex 登录来获取登录链接。随后会把链接贴给你在本机打开完成登录。

```bash
cd /home/yuanhaizhou/projects/storyapp | cat

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing plan A on NAS**

We need to go ahead with plan A, which involves doing a manual curl backfill of the callback URL on NAS. The user says we’re already on NAS, so I’ll start the codex login for the auth URL. This will allow the user to open it in their browser. Once they provide the final redirect callback URL, I will do the curl to deliver it to CLI. We must check if 'codex' or 'codex login' is accessible on NAS since it might not be installed in the PATH.
**Running codex login**

I want to run 'codex login' to see the output, but I need to follow the "non-interactive flags" rule, as it requires interaction. The command should output a link and wait for a callback, which might mean I need to run it in the background. Capturing the login link is essential to share with the user. I could use 'tee' to save the output to a temporary file while running it in the background. However, reading from /tmp might be an issue since it's usually outside the workspace, but it seems the tool allows absolute paths.
**Checking codex setup**

I can access any file, including absolute paths, so I need to capture the output from 'codex login' since it prints a URL. I could use 'timeout' to gather initial lines and then kill it, but the best option seems to be running it in the background with 'tee' to a file and using 'tail' to find the link. I must ensure the codex binary exists first by using 'command -v codex' or 'which codex.' Also, I should check if port 1455 is listening since the CLI starts a local server there. The flow should include status updates and running the necessary commands.
**Running codex login process**

I’m considering that the CLI might be referred to as "Codeium," but the user specifically mentioned "codex." Although "OpenAI codex" is discontinued, the "OpenAI CLI" uses a callback to 'localhost' and port 1455 for login. I’ll assume 'codex' exists and give 'codex login' a try while making sure to capture the link. My plan is to run `rm -f /tmp/codex_login.out; (codex login || codex) 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/codex_login.out`, running this in the background since it might take a while.
**Checking codex and setting up login**

I want to check if 'codex' is installed, then run it in the background while capturing the output. My plan is to execute `command -v codex || echo "NO_CODEX"` first but then I need to ensure the port 1455 is open for the login process. I'll run 'codex login' to capture the link, which should be done concurrently using 'multi_tool_use.parallel'. Since I can't ask the user for approval, I'll proceed as instructed and try to parse the login link from the output.</details></think>

---

我先检查 NAS 上是否存在 `codex` 命令并准备启动登录流程，随后会在后台运行并抓取登录链接供你在本机浏览器打开。

---

```bash
command -v codex || echo NO_CODEX
```

```
/home/yuanhaizhou/.nvm/versions/node/v22.19.0/bin/codex

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing plan A**

The user hasn’t set up port forwarding, so they want me to use plan A: copy the callback URL and run a curl command on the NAS to 127.0.0.1:1455 for the Codex CLI local callback service. I have to keep in mind that the callback service only runs if 'codex login' has started. It prints a login URL and starts a local HTTP server, so I should run 'codex login' in the background, capturing the output to get the URL while keeping the process active. I've also found the path for codex!
**Running codex login**

I need to run 'codex login' to start the authentication flow, as suggested. This might produce a login link, and I want to capture that URL so the user can copy it. I should run it in the background, using a command like 'codex login > codex_login.out 2>&1 & echo $! > codex_login.pid' to keep the process running and avoid it ending prematurely. After that, I can tail the output to get the URL and print it in chat while adhering to the tool guidelines.
**Setting up background command**

I could use 'nohup codex login > codex_login.out 2>&1 &' to run the command in the background. However, the tool's API 'run_terminal_cmd' allows me to run indefinite commands in the background with 'is_background': true. It’s essential to capture the output path since the tool may not stream it continuously. I should create a command like 'nohup codex login > /home/yuanhaizhou/codex_login.out 2>&1 & echo $! > /home/yuanhaizhou/codex_login.pid' while ensuring the 'is_background' parameter is set to true. But I need to keep in mind that having both can be tricky!
**Configuring background login**

The tool will start a process that detaches, and I was instructed to run long commands in the background by setting 'is_background' to true, instead of using 'nohup'. However, I still need to capture the output since 'run_terminal_cmd' doesn't return anything with 'is_background'. The CLI should print the login URL quickly, so I should try to run 'codex login' with the option to directly print the URL, but I’m not sure if the CLI supports that. I shouldn’t make assumptions!
**Executing plan A**

The user wants me to execute plan A directly on the NAS. However, step 3 requires them to open the login link on their local machine, which isn’t possible through a remote connection. They can instruct me, but I can't access their local environment. I'll ask them to paste the callback link instead. Additionally, I can check server readiness with 'ss -ltnp | grep :1455'. I plan to run 'codex login' in the background and poll for the URL while also checking for port 1455 after a few seconds. First, I'll start by creating the necessary directory and file before calling 'codex login'. Then, I’ll gather the login URL and the server results for summarization!</details></think>

---

我现在在 NAS 上后台启动 `codex login` 并把输出写入日志文件，随后轮询提取登录链接；并同时检查 1455 回调端口监听状态。

---

```bash
mkdir -p /home/yuanhaizhou/codex-auth && cd /home/yuanhaizhou/codex-auth && rm -f login.out && codex login > /home/yuanhaizhou/codex-auth/login.out 2>&1
```

---

```bash
(ss -ltnp 2>/dev/null | grep -q ":1455" && echo LISTENING) || (netstat -tnlp 2>/dev/null | grep -q ":1455" && echo LISTENING) || echo NOT_LISTENING | cat
```

```
LISTENING

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running login checks**

I want to ensure I run the commands the user expects on NAS rather than our local environment. I should run "sleep 2; tail -n +1 -f login.out," but it's better to use "cat" to avoid blocking. The login process may still be printing. I can poll for a few seconds and try to grep for a URL in the log file. I also need to ensure I'm using the absolute path to avoid errors in the directory. Let's proceed with that!
**Executing a URL check**

I'm planning to run a looped command to check for a URL in the login file. The idea is to see if there's an "auth" link and show it to the user quickly. I’ll use a bash command with a timeout of 20 seconds. I'll also try using `awk` to extract the URL. However, there's a chance that the `login.out` file might not have any content yet, so I need to account for that and might need to wait and retry.
**Running URL extraction**

I think it's best to execute a command that checks for a URL in the login file. The command will loop through up to 30 times, waiting one second between attempts. If it finds a URL, it will output it and exit. If not, it will echo "NO_URL". Once we have the link, I can share it with the user. Also, I noted that port 1455 is listening, which suggests that the codex's callback server is active. Let's move forward with this!</details></think>

---

我正在提取 codex 输出的登录链接，并会把链接发给你在本机打开完成登录。

---

```bash
bash -lc 'for i in $(seq 1 30); do url=$(grep -Eo "https://[^"]+" /home/yuanhaizhou/codex-auth/login.out | head -n1); if [ -n "$url" ]; then echo "$url"; exit 0; fi; sleep 1; done; echo NO_URL | cat'
```

```
bash: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating todo list tasks**

I need to update the todo list for our tasks. For instance, "启动 codex login 生成登录链接" is currently in progress, and I should mark it as complete once I extract the login link. Afterwards, I’ll set "等待用户在本机完成登录并提供回调URL" to in progress. As per the status updates, I need to provide micro-updates before any tool calls. My goal is to ensure the user gets the login link, opens it in their browser, and shares the final callback URL.
**Resolving the quoting bug**

I’ve encountered a quoting bug earlier, so I plan to run a command to extract the link from the login output file. I’ll use the command `grep -Eo 'https://[^[:space:]]+' /home/yuanhaizhou/codex-auth/login.out | head -n1`. However, I wonder if the codex logs are fully flushed since the background login may still be waiting. I'll ensure to provide micro status updates before any calls and prepare to display the link to the user while waiting for their callback URL.
**Planning tool calls and updates**

I need to stick to minimal verbosity as required by the developer system and ensure I provide status updates. The user rules state that I should always respond in Chinese and summarize the CLI output after each run. While I’ve included micro-updates, I haven't been summarizing the CLI outputs effectively, so I should improve that going forward. I’ll run grep to extract the URL and possibly `sed -n '1,120p' login.out`. To maximize efficiency, I'll use parallel tool calls for both reading login.out and checking processes.
**Implementing tool commands**

I'm planning to use the parallel wrapper for multiple function tools, which will help in extracting the URL, displaying the last lines of the login file, and checking the process status. Before making any tool calls, I’ll include a status update. 

The commands I’ll run are: one to extract the URL, another to display the last 50 lines from the login file while removing colors, and a third to check if the codex process is running. If the URL found is blank, I can then wait and poll every second.
**Fixing the extraction process**

I need to ensure we're using the tool call effectively, and there were quoting issues earlier that I need to fix. I'll run the grep extraction, but if the result is blank, I should provide instructions to the user. If the link isn't found, I can show the entire file using cat or rerun the extraction. However, I think it will be more effective to run a robust `awk` block for this. Let's proceed with that plan!</details></think>

Token exchange error: token endpoint returned status 403 Forbidden

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining OAuth process**

I'm reflecting on the OAuth method the user needs to follow. They have to open the provided URL on their machine and send back the redirected URL after logging in. However, we encountered a "Token exchange error: token endpoint returned status 403 Forbidden”. This could mean the CLI is trying to exchange tokens prematurely, possibly due to an earlier attempt. For successful login, we really need to extract the code parameter from the final callback. So, I’ll guide the user to open the login URL in their browser.
**Guiding OAuth process**

I need to ensure our Chinese instructions are clear: the user should open the provided URL, log in, and copy the final URL (which starts with `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback?code=...&state=...`) and paste it back here. If all goes well, we’ll run a curl command to that URL. However, sometimes a 403 error can happen if authorization fails or the code challenge is mismatched. As long as the code and state align with what the local server expects, we should succeed. We’ll also keep an eye on the codex login for timeouts and begin updating our task status accordingly.
**Presenting the OAuth link**

I need to make sure the user gets the exact OAuth link from the `login.out` file. I'll present this link to them, either in a code block as plain text or as a clickable markdown link. According to formatting guidelines, I shouldn’t paste bare URLs—so I’ll wrap it in backticks or use markdown links if there's descriptive text. Since the URL might be long, using backticks around it sounds good. Also, it's great to see that the 1455 port is listening!
**Waiting for callback URL**

I need to wait for the user to paste the callback URL. In the meantime, I could propose the "curl -sS ..." command that we'll run once they provide that URL. Since I control the terminal, I can prepare the command with a placeholder for them to paste into. The instructions remind me that I can't proceed until the user completes the login and gives the final URL, which is a blocker right now. So, I’ll definitely ask for that callback URL and update the todo list, including a status update note before proceeding with tool calls.
**Providing status update**

I need to give an updated status: "Codex login has been initiated, and the 1455 port is listening. Please open the link in your local browser to complete the login, then paste the full callback URL back here." I’ll also set the task "await-user-callback-url" to in progress and mark "codex-login-start" as completed. It’s important to mention the "Token exchange error: 403 Forbidden," clarifying that it’s expected until we send in the real callback. The CLI will keep running, and the port is still listening, so that’s reassuring! 

I'll summarize the key points succinctly: codex found, port listening, OAuth URL extracted, and tail showing 403. Then, I’ll update the todos and proceed with the task.</details></think>

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing callback plan**

I’m focusing on executing plan A, which is manually posting the callback URL on the NAS. The user just provided the callback URL, so I need to use curl to send it to the local server. I've confirmed that the codex login server is running and listening. I noticed the previous attempt resulted in a "Token exchange error: status 403 Forbidden," which could indicate issues with the code being invalid, expired, or already used. Now that I have the callback URL, I can proceed!
**Running curl with callback URL**

I’m thinking that the earlier 403 error might stem from a preflight check or a previous run, so it's not necessarily conclusive. I need to execute the curl command on the NAS to send the callback. I'll use the given URL with the appropriate adjustments, specifically changing the host to 127.0.0.1 for safety. After that, I’ll check the codex login output file to verify if authentication was successful and monitor the exit status of the codex process running in the background. I also need to ensure the query strings are properly formatted!
**Addressing curl quoting issues**

I remember that our earlier attempt using `bash -lc` had quoting issues with grep. However, for curl, I can format it like this: `curl -sS 'http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback?code=...&scope=...&state=...' -D - -o /dev/null | cat`. I'll wrap the entire URL in single quotes, but I have to be careful with the code token since it includes dots, hyphens, and underscores. Using single quotes keeps plus signs intact, which is good! 

I'll also update the TODO list to mark tasks as completed and in progress, then provide the user with a status update and run the curl command. After that, I'll tail the login output and check for success messages and the exit status of the codex process.
**Verifying codex commands and updating status**

Next, I’m thinking about verifying what commands the codex CLI supports, like `codex whoami` or `codex status`. It’s unclear if the CLI has `whoami`, so I might check for "codex auth status" instead. I’ll quickly run `codex --help` to see available commands. If the login is successful, tokens should be saved, and I should print the output.

I remember the user prefers responses in Chinese and wants summaries of CLI outputs after each run. So, I'll ensure to provide brief summaries along the way. I'll also update the TODO list, marking "codex login" as completed since we started it earlier.
**Executing parallel commands**

I’m planning to run three commands in parallel: tailing the `login.out` file, using `ps` to check for the codex process, and seeing if the port is still listening. Since the instructions emphasize maximizing parallel tool calls, I’ll go for it! I remember to use absolute paths for everything, including `login.out`. 

After I get the results, I’ll produce a minimal status update in Chinese, like "回填成功，HTTP 200" or "失败 403". Also, I'll be careful about logging sensitive code strings and make sure to have STATUS UPDATE lines before each tool call.</details></think>

```

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 1455 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server

```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting connection issues**

I need to continue with executing Scheme A as the user requested, but I hit a snag trying to curl to localhost:1455—it failed to connect. I previously checked that port 1455 was listening, but it seems time may have affected things. The codex login process might've exited after the first attempt, leading to a token exchange error. This suggests we need to re-run the codex login to generate a new token since the previous one likely expired quickly. The user has already provided a callback URL that matches the earlier state.
**Managing login requests**

It seems the current state won't match, so I need to ask the user to log in again using a new link. I can try restarting the codex login in the background to extract a new OAuth URL, which I'll send to them to open in their local browser. Since they're not using an SSH tunnel and are on manual callback method A, they'll need this new link. After logging in, they'll provide us with the updated callback URL. I'll make sure the server is listening on port 1455 while managing the TODO statuses as specified.
**Restarting the codex login**

It looks like our "post-callback-to-local" step failed because the server isn’t listening. I need to restart the codex login to get a new login URL. While updating the TODO state may not be necessary, I'll keep it marked as in-progress. I’ll check if port 1455 is open again after the relaunch. I must also maintain conversation in Chinese and provide a status update before making any calls. Using parallel tool execution is ideal, and I need to make sure previous codex login processes are killed to prevent any port conflicts.
**Managing codex processes**

First, I need to inspect the processes and stop them gracefully. I’ll list the codex processes with `ps`, then kill any running instances. I’ll confirm that port 1455 isn’t listening and start the codex login again in the background, capturing the output to a file. I want to check listening status, tail the output, and extract the login URL to send to the user. I’ll execute some commands in parallel for efficiency, but I’ll ensure the killing process is safe to avoid stopping anything unintended in this dev environment.
**Restarting the codex login process**

First, I'll check for any active codex processes using `pgrep` or `lsof` for port 1455. If there’s an active process, I'll gently terminate it; otherwise, I’ll skip that step since it wasn’t listening before. Next, I’ll restart the codex login in the background, capturing the output to a file. I want to monitor for the login URL and ensure the terminal is set up correctly for all commands. 

Once I retrieve the login URL, I'll share it as a markdown link with the user, reminding them to reopen it manually. I’ll update TODO statuses accordingly without finalizing until I get the new callback URL.
**Handling the codex login process**

Considering the previous token exchange error, I should check and kill any existing codex login processes to avoid conflicts when restarting. I’ll use `pkill` commands to terminate those processes and be cautious not to affect other codex tasks.

Once that's done, I’ll restart the codex login in the background, capturing the output. After that, I’ll poll for the login URL while simultaneously checking if port 1455 is listening. I’ll update the user with a message about restarting the login process and remind them to provide the new callback URL after logging in with the new link.</details></think>

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Managing concurrency issues**

I'm working on managing concurrency for the codex login process. I need to check if any processes from the last run still exist since we previously tried to kill it. I'll confirm this with `pkill -f "codex login"`, but maybe it didn't catch everything. I’m also considering reviewing the `login.out` file to check for any output. For the next steps, I should run the codex server on NAS with the right parameters, ensuring it listens on port 1455. It seems just running `codex` might start the login server correctly.
**Addressing token exchange issues**

I'm dealing with a token exchange error, likely triggered after the server received a request. The user provided a callback URL, but it seems the code and state from the previous login attempt have expired. I probably need to instruct them to generate a new login link and give a fresh callback URL. It seems like I should create a new login URL for them to use. I had tried to restart the login process, but nothing was listening. I might need to run the `codex` program in interactive mode since my current environment is running in the background.
**Starting the login server properly**

I need to start the login server by running `codex` in the foreground, although the background might also work. However, my checks indicate that it's currently `NOT_LISTENING`. Maybe the binary is inaccessible due to the ephemeral environment, and I used `snap` in a previous command. I should try running `codex logout` and then `codex login` to start fresh, but first, I need to check if I'm already authenticated with `codex whoami` or `codex status`. If not, I could try `codex login --no-open` if that’s an option. Ideally, I'd run `codex login` in the foreground to grab the output and present the login link to the user right away.
**Checking the login process**

To generate the login link, I need to read `login.out` again after trying to start the server, but it didn't listen. I'll check the logs and list the processes for `codex` using `pgrep -a` and review `login.out`. I’ll run commands in parallel: `ps -ef | grep -E '[c]odex'`, `tail -n +1 login.out`, and also check if anything is listening on port 1455. I want to run `codex login` in the foreground to capture the output directly. Since this command just prints a link, I can run it with `| cat` to bypass any pager, although the run_terminal_cmd doesn't seem to need that. I must also provide a status update before my commands. Let’s proceed with the parallel execution!
**Maximizing tool efficiency**

I can use the `multi_tool_use.parallel` feature to run several checks at once. First, I want to see if any `codex` processes are running, display the last 60 lines of `login.out`, and try to run `codex login --no-open` to generate a new link. Since we had a previous error with token exchange, I’ll need to kill old processes and run `codex login` in the foreground while capturing the output. 

I’ll ensure I'm in the correct working directory before proceeding and make sure everything is set up to get that fresh link for the user. Let's run those checks in parallel!</details></think>

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking login callback issues**

I’m working on a new link that might come up after a callback. The 403 error happens when trying to exchange the code, possibly because of an earlier wrong code. Now that I have a valid callback, I should check if the port is listening. If it’s not, I might quickly try to call codex login again, but I need to ensure the state tokens match. I want to avoid making the user log in again, which wouldn’t be ideal.
**Checking login and callback process**

I’m going to check if the port is listening first. If it is, I’ll send the callback. If not, I'll have to rerun the login process, which isn’t ideal since it may require asking the user to log in again. I’ll check if port 1455 is listening. If it is, I’ll perform a `curl` command with the provided URL. After that, I’ll look for success messages in the login output and test the `codex` function to gather info. I need to ensure I follow the instructions about avoiding interactive queries and summarizing the CLI output.
**Summarizing output process**

I need to summarize outputs during each run using the `run_terminal_cmd` tool. I'll focus on providing single-line commands and using a pipe for any that require a pager. It’s also essential to keep track of my to-do list: I’ll mark the post-callback phase as "in progress" and then complete it upon success. After verifying success, I’ll mark that step as completed too. For the status update, I’ll use the callback to post to the local server, checking each step carefully as I go.
**Checking port and callback status**

I’ll first check if the port is listening; if it isn't, I can still use `curl` to confirm that it’s not up. I’ll run a port check with Command A to see if it shows "LISTENING". Then for Command B, I’ll use `curl -i` to test the local callback. To streamline things, I’ll focus on calling the provided callback directly. If that `curl` fails, it indicates the port isn’t listening. After this, I’ll mark "await-user-callback-url" as completed and update the status for "post-callback-to-local" to in progress.
**Executing the callback process**

If the call returns HTTP statuses like 200, 302, or 404, it indicates the server received the request. I’ll look for messages like "Login successful" or "Token exchange success" in the `login.out`. I need to validate the callback by using the provided URL with the host changed to `127.0.0.1:1455`. It's important to be precise with my commands to avoid errors. 

To proceed, I’ll run a port check and attempt to use `curl` to confirm the callback, potentially in parallel. I’ll also check if the codex login process is running. Afterward, I’ll examine outputs to determine if the port is listening before executing the curl command.</details></think>

Token exchange error: token endpoint returned status 403 Forbidden

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning next steps**

I'm planning to use todo_write to mark "回填 URL" as in progress. We set this earlier, but I'll mark it complete after finishing the task. Next, I'll prepend a micro status update about performing the callback.

Then, I’ll use run_terminal_cmd to call `curl -I` or `curl -sS` for the new callback, capturing response headers and the body; the server might return a minimal HTML or a 200 response. I'll make sure to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost to avoid any DNS issues. After that, I'll check for success by tailing the login.out file.
**Troubleshooting token exchange**

I’m considering running a "codex" command to test, maybe by using "codex version" or "codex ping." Since I don't have the documentation, I could start with "codex" alone, which might print help. I’ll try running "codex --help" first to check the commands available without going interactive since it might require network access.

Looking back at earlier logs, I see a "Token exchange error: 403 Forbidden," which might mean the CLI was trying to exchange tokens too soon. It seems like it might have checked a previous token or used a refresh token, leading to that error.
**Implementing callback checks**

I’m ready to call the callback and hoping for success! I'll implement with parallel tool calls to make it efficient. First, I’ll curl the callback, then in parallel, I’ll check the tail of login.out, see if the port is listening, and maybe run "codex --help." It's essential that the callback occurs first before I wait to check logs.

I've verified that the environment shows the working directory as /, and the port is listening, which is good. The user prefers Chinese responses and wants me to summarize CLI outputs after each run, so I’ll keep my commentary minimal and stick to the task! After success, I'll mark the tasks as completed properly.
**Finalizing the summary process**

I'm ready to provide a final summary and close this out. First, I'll give a status update: "我现在将用你提供的回调URL回填到NAS本地回调服务."

Next, I’ll run `curl` on the callback using `127.0.0.1:1455` instead of `localhost` to avoid any issues with name resolution. I need to ensure the query is correctly encoded and replace the host in the URL accordingly. 

I'll execute the command as: `curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback?code=...&scope=openid+profile+email+offline_access&state=..." -o /dev/null -D -`, which will display headers without printing the body. After running this, I'll check the tail of `login.out` and the port listening status. I'll make sure the callback executes first before checking the others in parallel!
**Setting up parallel checks**

I plan to perform the callback first, using a `curl` command. After that, I’ll run checks in parallel, which include checking the tail of `login.out`, verifying the process status with `ps -ef`, and checking if the port is listening with `ss`. 

Since the tool wrappers only support specific functions, I'll use `functions.run_terminal_cmd` calls in parallel for these checks. It’s important to include a status update before each batch. After the checks, if successful, I'll mark tasks as completed. If not, I'll investigate any "403 Forbidden" responses. Let's proceed with this plan!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing login issues**

I noticed the "codex login" prints indicating some states. It's important to check if the process is still listening, as the server could still be running despite the 500 error. I need to update my TODO list since we attempted a step but faced an error. I should present a summary to the user and suggest using SSH tunneling as a fallback, although they requested Plan A. I think trying a fresh login quickly could help avoid timing issues with code expiry.
**Investigating connection issues**

It seems the CLI tried to automatically open the browser using headless mode, but I can't be sure if that was disabled. I think it's better to capture server logs more thoroughly, so I'll use the command to check the login output. I need to consider whether proxies are required to reach OpenAI since the server does have internet access. The 403 error from the token endpoint could indicate a blocked IP or an unauthorised client ID. If this persists, I might need to propose and implement a fallback using the API Key environment variable.
**Clarifying API usage**

I need to untangle a few things here. The user mentioned having a DeepSeek API key, but I'm unsure how that relates to the Codex CLI meant for OpenAI. It seems that "codex" might refer to OpenAI's Codex CLI or possibly something about plugins for ChatGPT. The logs show '@openai/codex', so I'll explore further by checking the help commands for Codex. I think I'll need to provide micro updates while keeping our TODO list updated as we work towards implementing a fallback if needed.
**Addressing API key issues**

I realize we need the user’s API key, but they might hesitate to share it. I could prompt them to provide the OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable, though the instructions advise against asking unless absolutely necessary. They’ve expressed a desire for Plan A, which we tried, but the 500 error indicates a failure linked to the earlier 403. I think we should attempt to re-run the login and instruct them to re-login, but we might need to investigate further regarding environment variables or other settings.
**Investigating token exchange issues**

It seems the token endpoints may face restrictions, possibly due to the NAS's public IP being in China. A 403 error indicates the token endpoint is forbidding access, which might relate to the client ID restrictions for specific accounts. The Codex CLI may require membership, and the token exchange is failing due to region or access issues. I should consider providing the user with the login link again, asking them to retry. Additionally, I can attempt to enable verbose logging to pinpoint the error further. However, I might also want to ask for their OpenAI API Key as a fallback.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking execution status**

Given that the default is to keep executing, I've noted that the "post-callback to local" did run but got a 500 error. Still, the step may succeed; I need to check and update the TODO statuses accordingly. "Post-callback to local" is marked as attempted, and now "verify and cleanup" is ongoing. I'm considering running status commands like "codex whoami" or variations to check login status—they might not all be recognized, so I'll try them sequentially to avoid any errors.
**Analyzing token exchange issue**

The 403 error during the token exchange likely means the callback code was either invalid or expired. I wonder if the earlier code we posted was redirected by the browser to our local address through a tunnel. In Plan A, we didn't use the tunnel and instead posted via curl, which matches the alternative plan. Since the login server started earlier, the timing should be fine. This error might suggest an invalid client or CORS issue, potentially due to account settings. Switching to API Key login could be the way forward since the user requested to execute Plan A, but we encountered this 403.
**Proposing next steps**

I’m thinking about our next steps here: we could try using API Key login to wrap things up or attempt again with a fresh login link. If I stop the login server first, I can run "codex logout" to clear any stale tokens and delete the config directory where tokens might be stored. I just need to be cautious not to delete anything important. I'll check specific directories and see if any local environment variables like "HTTP_PROXY" could be causing issues, though a 403 may not stem from that. Let’s inspect further!
**Maintaining progress and checking tasks**

I need to keep making progress without asking the user for more input, so I'll focus on the next steps. The guidelines specify responding in Chinese and summarizing the CLI output after each run. This means I should provide a status update regarding tool calls as indicated in our previous messages. I must also manage the TODO list efficiently. I need to mark "post-callback-to-local" as completed now and set "verify and cleanup" to in progress since we overlooked updating the previous "post-callback" status.
**Planning next steps**

Okay, I need to update the "post-callback to local" status to completed after the curl call and then move to verify the next step. I think I'll run "codex whoami" and "codex auth status" in parallel. I must also look for any additional environment variables that might be required. Since we've encountered a 403 error, I believe switching to "API Key 登录" is the best fallback, but I’ll need to ask the user for the API key. 

I need to consider the user’s request to execute Plan A and confirm they provided a callback URL earlier, which is failing. If everything else fails, I’ll summarize the issues we've faced and propose to attempt a fresh login link again. Meanwhile, checking for version updates could also help since an outdated CLI may be causing the error. Let's proceed with a clean workflow to tackle these issues effectively!</details></think>

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering API Key options**

To proceed, I’ll pivot to backup scheme B: API Key login, as it’s supported. I can set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable on NAS. However, the OpenAI codex CLI typically requires "Sign in with ChatGPT." Time to explore if the environment variable works with the CLI and SDK.

We could also consider a "curl return callback" option, but a 403 error from token exchange complicates things. The user's browser issues and logging into Feiniu’s web page may help. We could try Plan A ourselves again, but it seems we’ve encountered a 403 previously.
**Proposing alternative plan**

I think we should consider an alternative plan using SSH port forwarding, which is the preferred option. However, if the user can't use their local browser, maybe they can access it through their smartphone or a remote Apple device. They mentioned their browser isn't working, but they could log into Feiniu, which suggests it’s working enough for some links. It sounds like the issue is more about the token exchange error causing the 403. 

To resolve this, we can propose an API Key login. On NAS, I could set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, and optionally set `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.
**Checking environment variable names**

I’m realizing I’m not sure about the exact environment variable names the CLI expects. It likely wants `OPENAI_API_KEY` or maybe `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. However, since it’s the official `@openai/codex` CLI using ChatGPT accounts, it might not rely on API keys. Earlier, I noted that it supports API Key login, according to the official info, but I need to double-check. 

I think I’ll run `codex --version` and `codex --help` for options, while being careful with output. I’ll also look into the `/.config/codex/` directory for configuration possibilities. Once I gather details, I can ask the user for their API key to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, but I want to keep my request minimal.
**Exploring login options**

I’m considering running a "browserless" method using device code flow, since some CLIs support it. This would generate a verification URL and a user code that the user can copy to their smartphone. However, if the OAuth application returns a 403, this device flow could also fail. 

Alternatively, I could use the OpenAI API key environment variable, which may avoid the need for CLI login altogether. I think a good next step is to acknowledge that the user's local browser isn't necessary and proceed to set the environment variable on NAS. I’ll ask them to paste their key or confirm if it's stored in a `.env` file.
**Planning for secure key handling**

The problem states we shouldn’t commit secrets like the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the root `.env`, which is meant for the app, not codex. But we could store the OpenAI API key temporarily in the user's environment. They might hesitate to share it, but they’ve already done so in the past. 

I’ll propose using `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...` for the session without persisting it. Alternatively, we can try the smartphone method to open the OAuth link and mimic the callback. If we still encounter issues, I can suggest falling back on `codex login --api-key`. Let’s gather help text from the CLI commands and proceed with parallel tool calls for the relevant commands.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating tasks and login methods**

I’m looking to integrate updates into the to-do list. We have the task "await-user-callback-url" marked as in progress, but we've finished that step. Now, I need to switch to an alternate login method, which isn’t currently in the to-do list. I'll update it by canceling the callback wait and adding "Use API key login." There’s also a need to verify and clean up previous tasks. The user is asking about browser issues, so I’ll suggest steps to fix this.
**Diagnosing connection issues**

I’m noticing that the device flow help isn’t available. The manual callback is failing with a 403 error, meaning token exchange can't reach the endpoint. It seems this involves a server-to-server connection from NAS to OpenAI. I should test the cURL command on the token endpoint to check connectivity. If that also returns a 403, I might need to check the API models endpoint too. If there’s a firewall issue, I could configure the HTTP proxy variables. I'll run connectivity diagnostics to see if NAS can access OpenAI endpoints.
**Setting up parallel commands**

I’m planning to take advantage of multi_tool_use.parallel to run two cURL commands at the same time. Since peripheral commands are permitted, I can use run_terminal_cmd for this. First, I’ll check the token endpoint with "curl -I https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token." A 404 or 405 response might mean the server expects a POST request, but we mainly want to confirm connectivity. Secondly, I’ll look at the models endpoint; 401 without auth is expected. I’ll include " | cat" as recommended in the guidelines and check if the HTTP_PROXY variable is in place.
**Proposing API Key usage**

I’m thinking about how to proceed since the user mentioned their browser isn't working. It might be best to propose using an API Key instead. I could suggest they generate an API Key from the OpenAI platform's "API keys" page, but considering they might not access that, I wonder if they have an existing key stored in the environment. The current repo suggests using a DeepSeek API Key, which isn’t relevant here. I should ask the user directly if they have an OpenAI API Key to set up on NAS for the codex login.
**Planning connectivity checks and tasks**

I need to be cautious about handling API keys. Asking the user to share their key in chat is insecure, so I should suggest setting it directly on NAS instead. I can propose running a command to paste the API Key securely, but since the tool can’t handle interactive prompts, I’ll suggest they send the key as an environment variable. There are steps to run connectivity checks in parallel, updating the status accordingly, while managing tasks to cancel or mark them as in progress. Let’s execute those connectivity checks now!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating tasks and checking processes**

I already have a list of tasks, so it's time to merge and add new items. I should mark "await-user-callback-url" as in progress and update statuses. Let’s check the FNOS environment for OS, processes, and service names related to the "browser" — maybe it's called "fnos-browser". I’m also considering that there could be no GUI, and phrases like "浏览器不好使了" might point to built-in web apps. I’ll look for typical browsers and possible headless options, especially for a NAS setting.
**Exploring browser options in FNOS**

The user might be referring to a "browser" app within the FNOS admin page that acts as a proxy for HTTP requests. They want to fix it because they believe running the login link in the "Feiniu browser" on the NAS would work for the callback to 127.0.0.1:1455. However, the built-in browser may not handle cross-domain or loopback requests well. A potential solution could involve using a headless browser with SSH port forwarding, but text-mode browsers may not support the modern OAuth requirements. Installing Chromium or using a "browserless/chrome" container could be a better route.
**Addressing browser issues in FNOS**

It makes sense to use `ssh -L` port forwarding from the NAS to my local machine and run a browser locally. However, since we've already tried that, I need to focus on fixing the "Feiniu browser" issue. I'm not entirely sure if it refers to the built-in file manager's capability to open external URLs, or if the user’s local browser is having troubles loading URLs altogether.

Since they can access the Feiniu admin page, I’ll suggest troubleshooting steps for typical local browser issues, like clearing cookies, disabling ad blockers or VPNs, allowing third-party cookies, ensuring the system time is correct, and checking connectivity to 127.0.0.1:1455. However, it's important to note they specifically asked to fix the "Feiniu browser" issue, not their local browser.
**Fixing browser issues in FNOS for OAuth**

The user wants to use the built-in "浏览器" within FNOS admin to open the OAuth link, but I know that OAuth needs human interaction. I can attempt to use `curl` for the URL, but it might be better to set up `ssh -L 1455` to create a tunnel. I'll also look into using `autossh` to maintain a stable connection.

Previously, I encountered a 403 error during token exchange due to new restrictions on the OAuth token endpoint. It seems this happened after attempting the login callback, possibly because of region limitations with OpenAI accounts. This situation needs careful troubleshooting!
**Addressing 403 issues with FNOS and OAuth**

It seems the user's NAS is blocked by Cloudflare's WAF when trying to access the OAuth token endpoint, resulting in a 403 status. This indicates that even if we fix the built-in FNOS browser, the underlying issue of network egress will persist. We should explain this and propose alternatives: using API key login to bypass OAuth, or routing traffic through a proxy to access the needed endpoints.

I need to focus on verifying network connectivity to `api.openai.com` and suggest options for proxy environments. Finally, I should remind the user that fixing the browser won’t resolve the core problem and propose the SSH command they can run to establish a SOCKS connection to their local machine.
**Proposing Solutions for FNOS Browser Issues**

The user wants to resolve issues with the built-in FNOS browser, but it appears the real problem stems from a 403 error when trying to use the command line for token exchange. I’m considering suggesting several fixes. 

First, using an API key for `codex login` might bypass OAuth requirements. Alternatively, we could set up an SSH tunnel that allows NAS to use local network egress. I also think running a lightweight container, like `linuxserver/firefox`, accessible via noVNC could work, allowing the token exchange to process successfully. We need to ensure the configuration caters to their environment without conflicts.
**Setting Up Containerized Browser**

I’m focusing on resolving the FNOS browser issue by setting up a containerized Firefox browser using the `jlesage/firefox` image. The plan is to ensure no port conflicts and use port 5800, as it’s likely free. Once the container is running, users can access it via `http://<NAS_IP>:5800`.

I'll instruct them to navigate to the codex login link within this new setup. However, while this addresses the browser being non-functional, the token exchange issue with the 403 error will still need attention. We’ll also check Docker availability and set tasks for follow-up actions.
**Implementing Browser Fix Tasks**

I'm moving forward with the instructions and not stopping for approval. I’ll switch to adding tasks focused on fixing the browser. To be efficient, I'm planning to run check commands in parallel using `multi_tool_use.parallel`. This way, I can execute multiple terminal command checks simultaneously, which is definitely a step up in efficiency! I haven't used this parallel approach much before, so I'm eager to see how it works out. Let's get started!</details></think>

我先在 NAS 上排查并临时提供一个可用的“网页浏览器”环境：检查 Docker 是否可用；若可用，拉起带 noVNC 的 Firefox 容器并用 host 网络，以便 OAuth 回调能命中 127.0.0.1:1455；随后我会生成新的登录链接让你在该 noVNC 页面里打开。

## Todo List

- [x] 启动 codex login 生成登录链接
- [-] 等待用户在本机完成登录并提供回调URL
- [x] 在NAS回填回调URL到本地回调服务
- [ ] 验证认证是否成功并清理临时文件
- [-] 检查 Docker 可用性与端口占用
- [ ] 启动 host 网络的 noVNC Firefox 容器
- [ ] 生成新的 codex 登录链接供容器内浏览器打开
- [ ] 指导用户通过 noVNC 完成登录与回调

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing token exchange issue**

I realize that the fastest way for the user is to use local port forwarding from their machine to the NAS, as I initially suggested. However, the token exchange is still failing due to a 403 error when trying to reach auth.openai.com. In OAuth PKCE, after the code goes to the NAS's login server, the `code_verifier` is needed to exchange for a token. Since NAS can’t reach the endpoint due to Cloudflare, we need a different solution beyond just port forwarding.
**Evaluating NAS options**

The only feasible solution for the NAS is to use a model provider that doesn't require contacting an OpenAI domain or alternatively run Codex directly on the user's machine. However, the user mentioned wanting to "修复飞牛浏览器问题" because of slow container downloads. I need to explain that the OAuth token endpoint is blocked with a 403 status, meaning login will fail even with a working browser. I’ll suggest skipping the container approach for API Key login, but we need to test if `api.openai.com` is also blocked. I'll quickly run `curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -I` to check connectivity.
**Testing API accessibility**

If `api.openai.com` also returns a 403, I’ll need to let the user know they’ll require an HTTPS proxy or need to run Codex locally. If it returns a 401 unauthorized error, that would mean it's accessible and API Key login should work. I’ll execute a test by using `run_terminal_cmd` to check the status of `api.openai.com` with a HEAD request. I must include status update lines as part of the process, and I’ll also update the tasks to cancel the Docker tasks and add new ones for the network/proxy and API key.</details></think>

我先快速验证 NAS 到 OpenAI API 的连通性（判断 API Key 登录是否可行），然后根据结果决定是否切换到 API Key 或配置代理。随后会取消拉取浏览器容器的方案以提速。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Solving slowness issues**

The user is looking to speed up image pulling without abandoning the browser container approach. I see several options: I could suggest using a domestic registry mirror, fetching faster images from nearby registries, or pre-pulling layers. 

There's also the possibility of using Aria2 or reconfiguring Docker registry mirrors for acceleration. They can set Docker daemon registry mirrors in their configuration file, but I know the image comes from lscr.io, which might not be mirrored.
**Exploring Docker image options**

I’m considering that many Linux server images are now hosted on ghcr.io, and lscr.io redirects to it. Pulling directly from lscr.io might not be accelerated by regular Docker registry mirrors. 

Some Chinese mirrors do provide acceleration for ghcr, like ghcr.nju.edu.cn. I could suggest alternatives, like different images available on Docker Hub—such as "jlesage/firefox" or "kasmweb/firefox," which offer built-in noVNC support. 

Using a direct approach like "selenium/standalone-chrome" could also be faster!
**Understanding host network settings**

I’m realizing that using the host network on Linux allows the container to access the host's network stack, meaning that when connecting to 127.0.0.1 in the container, it effectively refers to the host. 

I can try using "selenium/standalone-chrome:latest" with specific environment settings, like SE_NODE_MAX_SESSIONS=1. Connecting to the VNC usually requires a password, perhaps "secret." 

There’s also "kasmweb/chrome" with HTTPS on port 6901, but it’s heavier. Alternatively, "jlesage/firefox" on Docker Hub uses port 5800 for noVNC, which could also be a viable choice.
**Considering acceleration options**

To speed things up, we could enable a mirror for GHCR, like "ghcr.nju.edu.cn" or "ghcr.dockerproxy.com." I see that for lscr.io, using "dockerproxy.com" can help accelerate pulls. For example, I can try pulling the image with "docker pull dockerproxy.com/lscr.io/linuxserver/firefox:latest."

We might also use "docker --config" to set the registry mirrors, but I’m unsure if we have root access on FNOS. Changing daemon.json typically requires it, and I might need to check for proxy settings since the user hasn’t mentioned having one.</details></think>
