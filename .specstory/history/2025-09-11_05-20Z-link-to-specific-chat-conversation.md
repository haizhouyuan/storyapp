_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Docker build issues**

I need to summarize the output once everything has finished running, but I realize I haven’t run any tools yet. The user’s query about a failed docker build is a bit ambiguous, so I need to interpret that they're facing connectivity issues with Docker Hub from China, possibly needing to use the Aliyun mirror. Their logs indicate they tried adding registry mirrors and restarting Docker. The error message shifted from a timeout to an "insufficient_scope" authorization issue, which might be related to credentials required for the Aliyun mirror.
**Navigating Docker Hub rate limits**

Considering the 2023 changes, Docker Hub rate limits and some mirrors being disabled, using the `m.daocloud.io` mirror seems best for users in China. I can also suggest the fully qualified mirror `docker.m.daocloud.io/library/node:18-alpine` or the deprecated `registry.docker-cn.com`. Alternatives include other images like `cgr.dev/chainguard/node:18` or `bitnami/node:18`. The logs show the USTC and 163 mirrors are defunct, so setting up recommended proxies like `dockerproxy.com` can improve connectivity.
**Improving Docker pull strategy**

The user still can’t pull, even after using `systemctl restart docker` on their Alibaba Cloud instance. A better solution might be to use `docker pull dockerproxy.com/library/node:18-alpine` or `m.daocloud.io`. Alternatively, they can set the mirror in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Editing the Dockerfile to use the m.daocloud mirror for the base image is a minimal change, but I should be cautious about committing this to the repository. The guidelines prefer step-by-step commands, which we should adhere to for clarity.
**Providing Docker Hub access solutions**

The logs indicate the user ran a docker compose build remotely, so I need to offer actionable steps for fixing Docker Hub access. I can suggest adding reliable mirrors to the `daemon.json`, such as `https://docker.m.daocloud.io`, and confirm after a restart by checking with `docker info`. They could try pulling the image directly from the mirror, then tagging it for local use without modifying the Dockerfile. Alternatively, they could modify the Dockerfile to reference the mirror directly or use `docker save` and `scp` to transfer an image from a connected machine.
**Exploring Dockerfile modifications**

I see another alternative: using `npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com` in the Dockerfile to speed up npm installs, but first, the issue is with pulling the base image due to network problems. I can propose a minimal change to the Dockerfile, specifically adding `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` to allow for overrides with `--build-arg`. It's also important to inspect the current `Dockerfile`.

Next, I need to read both the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to gather necessary information for a structured plan. I should create a todo list, which includes updating Docker mirrors, pulling the base image, modifying the Dockerfile if needed, and running the build again. I’ll also check other relevant files that might help with building the app service.</details></think>

我先查看仓库里的 `Dockerfile` 和 `docker-compose.yml`，确认当前基础镜像与构建方式，以便给出针对性的修复方案（镜像加速/替代方案/可配置 `ARG`）。随后会并行读取相关文件。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing code changes**

I’m focusing on the instructions for code changes which emphasize using tools effectively. I need to apply a patch and check the `Dockerfile` before making any edits to prevent mismatches. I’ll parameterize the Node image using `ARG` for a better pattern, like creating a single base node image. I can also add another `ARG` for the NPM registry to speed up installations, but I’ll need to be cautious as modifying the registry could lead to some package dependency issues.
**Configuring npm registry**

I’m thinking we should add an optional step to set the npm registry with `npm config set registry $NPM_REGISTRY` before running `npm ci`. I’ll default to `https://registry.npmjs.org` and use `ARG` for this in all builder stages. It’s important to run the config command after setting the working directory. I also need to ensure that the base image has npm accessible. Oh, and the current `COPY` command path seems funky since it aims for a directory that might not exist yet. We could create the `frontend` directory before copying.
**Reviewing npm setup**

I think we should consider removing `RUN npm install axios` in the final stage. It seems redundant since the backend `package.json` should already include axios, especially since `npm ci --omit=dev` installs from that file. It’s copying the backend `package*.json` into the root, expecting the `package.json` in `/app`. This might be a workaround to ensure axios is present, but since it might already be included, I’ll leave it for minimal changes. Using the npm mirror to reduce network calls will definitely be helpful!
**Updating docker-compose configuration**

I’m thinking we might update the `docker-compose.yml` to modify the build arguments and even disable BuildKit if necessary. I can do this by adding the environment variables `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` and `COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=0` specifically for the `app` service. I’ll need to check the current content of `docker-compose.yml` to ensure I make the right adjustments. Let's see what we have there!</details></think>

我将并行读取 `docker-compose.yml` 和 `docker-compose.dev.yml` 以检查构建配置、是否设置了 build args、以及是否可以在 compose 中禁用 BuildKit。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Docker imaging issues**

I’ve got some thoughts on the Docker Hub situation. It looks like the issue around "insufficient_scope: unauthorized" often relates to rate limits or authentication. The image name might be accessible without problems, but we could face network restrictions in certain regions. 

For alternatives, I could switch the base image to avoid these issues or try using a dedicated mirror like the one from Aliyun in China. There's also the option of creating a customizable Dockerfile to manage the Node images.
**Addressing base image pull issues**

I'm noticing that the primary issue here is with pulling the base image. The compose file's warning about the version being obsolete can be ignored; it's not the core problem. I’m considering security implications and realizing I can't switch to untrusted registries, but Aliyun and USTC are viable options.

One solution is to preload the base image on the server. I could also explore using the GitHub Container Registry, but I need to verify if they host the official Node images. There might be some configuration challenges as well.
**Investigating pull access issues**

The logs indicate I'm facing a "pull access denied" issue from the mirror, likely due to "insufficient_scope: authorization failed." This could be from rate limits or unauthorized access. I have several mirror addresses to try, including `ustc`, but some options are outdated or not recommended.

Also, setting the `DOCKERHUB_MIRROR` environment variable could help. I can suggest a clear step-by-step fix: first, I’ll adjust the Dockerfile to include an `ARG NODE_IMAGE` at the top for the base image. That should make switching easier.
**Clarifying ARG usage in Dockerfiles**

I’m realizing there are three `FROM` statements to consider, and I need the same argument for the run stage as well. If I'm using multiple `ARG` lines before each `FROM`, I have to define `ARG NODE_IMAGE` either before each `FROM` or globally before the first one. 

It seems the syntax requires me to re-declare the `ARG` for each stage if I want to use it. According to the Docker manual, an `ARG` declared before any `FROM` can’t be utilized after. That’s a bit tricky!</details></think>

_**User (2025-09-11 00:16Z)**_

是服务器上，不是本地

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting Docker configuration**

I need to modify the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file to include valid mirrors like `docker.m.daocloud.io` and others for better access. After that, I'll run `systemctl daemon-reload` and `systemctl restart docker`. Then I want to try pulling the Node image again. However, since the Great Firewall might interfere, I think it's smart to specify mirrors directly in the Dockerfile using build arguments. This way, I can easily customize it with parameters for different environments. I'll adjust the Dockerfile accordingly.
**Clarifying ARG usage in Dockerfile**

I'm focusing on how to use shell variable substitutions in the Dockerfile, specifically with `ARG` and `FROM`. It's crucial to declare `ARG` at the top-level or before each `FROM` if I want to use it for different stages. According to Docker documentation, `ARG` values are global but only valid within the build stage where they're defined. Since version 17.05, I can use `ARG` directly in the `FROM` line of the first stage, which simplifies referencing. I'll make sure to follow these rules for clarity!
**Using ARG in Dockerfile properly**

To use `ARG` in any `FROM` lines of the Dockerfile, I must declare it before each `FROM`. According to the documentation, an `ARG` defined before a `FROM` instruction can be referenced in subsequent `FROM` lines. It's essential to define it at the very start, like this: `ARG NODE_IMAGE=docker.m.daocloud.io/library/node:18-alpine`. Some older Docker versions might need `ARG` before every `FROM`, but since I'm on a modern server, I can reference directly or hardcode the value if needed. I'll also pay attention to the Compose file warnings!
**Interpreting Compose warnings and errors**

In the Compose file, I'm seeing `name: storyapp` instead of a `version` key since it's using Compose v2. However, there's a warning stating that the `version` key is obsolete, which seems confusing because I don’t see it in the local `docker-compose.yml`. It makes me wonder if there’s a different version on the server. But for now, I realize it's just a warning. The current issues I'm facing are "i/o timeout" and "insufficient_scope: authorization failed" while using mirrors.
**Planning Docker setup adjustments**

My plan involves updating the server's Docker daemon mirrors to valid options like DaoCloud and Tencent. I could also use external registries for Node images. The `cgr.dev/chainguard/node:18` option is viable, though it's not Alpine, so it might lack `apk`. To keep minimal changes, I want to propose updating `/etc/docker/daemon.json` to include valid mirrors. After restarting Docker, I'll verify by running a `docker info` command. If pulling from the mirror still fails, I’ll pre-pull and tag the image to streamline the build process.</details></think>

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering image registry solutions**

I’m thinking about improving the Docker image registry setup. Using multi-arg for the base image makes it easier to switch images by setting an ARG variable. On the server, I can build with --build-arg to use different registry options. However, since many known proxies might be discontinued, I need alternatives like pre-pulling the base image or using ACR to create a mirror repository. If there's an authorization issue, it suggests that the Hangzhou registry may require specific credentials.
**Clarifying the ACR usage**

I realized they used the ACR registry domain "registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com," which isn’t meant for mirroring, so it makes sense the failure occurred. They should really use "https://<your-accelerator-id>.mirror.aliyuncs.com" instead. I plan to advise them to fetch their personal accelerator endpoint from the Alibaba Cloud console. It's crucial to keep updates minimal, so I’ll guide them to modify the Dockerfile and docker-compose to include build args. They want to focus on server deployment, which is important to remember!
**Considering command execution tools**

I’m exploring the option of using the run_terminal_cmd tool to execute commands on the user's machine. It appears to allow proposing commands on their behalf, but they may need to approve them first. Since their OS is Windows PowerShell and the server is remote, I can use SSH commands with this tool. However, I need to be cautious, as users might prefer suggestions rather than actual execution. If I proceed, I’ll ensure to include status updates during the process. Should I go ahead and call run_terminal_cmd?
**Analyzing command execution and updates**

I'm noticing that the logs show attempts at remote SSH commands, possibly using an agent. To avoid issues, I’ll propose the proper commands rather than executing them directly. The guidelines suggest we keep going until everything is resolved, but we can push code changes even if some steps require execution on the server. I'll also need to update the `docker-compose.yml` to address warnings about the obsolete version directive. While the file doesn't show the `version:` property, the warning might stem from an older Compose version. My primary focus needs to be on fixing base image pulling by parameterizing it in the Dockerfile.
**Building with Node images and proxies**

I’m planning to set up two build stages referencing Node by defining `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` at the top. I have to remember that `ARG` declarations need to be in the correct order for each build stage. For Docker Compose, I’ll also add fallback options for China proxies in the build args. I'll suggest using the Alibaba Cloud Container Registry mirror service since they tried using an incorrect proxy before. We can propose pre-pulling Node images and copying them to the server as a backup plan while ensuring the docker configurations are set correctly.
**Implementing changes for Docker images**

I need to make several modifications. First, I'll add `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` to the top of the Dockerfile and apply this in all `FROM` lines. To speed up npm installations, I might include an optional `ARG NPM_REGISTRY` to set the npm registry to npmmirror.

I’ll suggest three fallback strategies: configuring a Docker mirror using Alibaba’s accelerator, using an alternative Node image if the mirror config fails, or preloading the base image via offline tar. The Compose warning about the obsolete version can be ignored, but we can address it if needed.</details></think>

我将创建一组待办来跟踪部署修复，并先编辑 `Dockerfile` 以参数化基础镜像和 NPM 源，从而便于在阿里云服务器上使用国内镜像构建。随后我会更新 `docker-compose.yml` 与 `docker-compose.dev.yml` 添加 build args。

## Todo List

- [-] 参数化 Dockerfile 基础镜像与 NPM 源以支持国内镜像
- [ ] 在 docker-compose.yml 与 docker-compose.dev.yml 中添加 build args
- [ ] 提供阿里云加速器与镜像方案以及服务器执行步骤

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Docker image pulls**

I encountered a "pull access denied" error, possibly because BuildKit is still using `registry-1.docker.io`. The error about "insufficient_scope: authorization failed" might indicate rate limiting on Docker Hub for anonymous access from Aliyun, suggesting I may need to log in. 

One solution is to switch base images to `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/library/node:18-alpine` in the Dockerfile. This could help avoid issues with direct Hub access. Though, minimal changes are preferred, server-level network issues might require using parameterization for customization. Another idea is to pre-pull images on the server and set the `--registry-mirror` correctly.
**Diagnosing Docker pull timeouts**

I'm seeing that `docker pull node:18-alpine` is timing out, even though I have the daemon registry mirrors configured. It seems the mirror might not support `library/node`. The provided mirrors include `registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com`, `ustc`, and `163`, but it looks like the Alibaba Cloud mirror requires a personalized endpoint. The generic configuration might be misconfigured since it's meant for user image pushes, not mirroring. 

Also, some Docker mirrors are now deprecated or unreachable, and many, like USTC, have ceased operations recently. I need to find reliable alternatives.
**Optimizing Docker image retrieval**

It's probably better to pull the official Node images from `registry-1.docker.io` via a proxy or use a Chinese registry like Tencent Cloud TCR public mirror that provides Node images. The USTC mirror is outdated, and "c.163.com" has ended, while an Alibaba Cloud personal mirror is also an option. 

Alternatively, I could suggest building artifacts offline or using GitHub Actions, then pushing them to a registry like Aliyun ACR. However, since the user prefers a server build, I should focus on making code changes to allow for parameterization and updating compose files to accept build arguments. Adding a `.dockerignore` file might also help optimize the process.
**Setting up Docker for efficiency**

I’m thinking about setting the `npm` and `yarn` registry to `https://registry.npmmirror.com`, the Chinese mirror, to speed up the install process. In the Dockerfile, I can set the NPM registry using `npm config set registry $NPM_REGISTRY` while also using `--prefer-offline`. However, `npm ci` will still pull from that registry.

I should add a fallback for `NODE_VERSION` to 18 and define `ARG BASE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine`. Although I'm realizing that `ARG` can be declared before each `FROM` in modern Dockerfiles, since they’re scoped globally until a new `FROM` is utilized. So I’ll make sure to structure it right!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Docker Image Issues**

I’m setting the base image in my Dockerfile to 'node:18-alpine', but I’m running into issues because Docker is pulling from docker.io and requires authentication. The error message points to issues with pull access or repository authorization. I could try using 'docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/google_containers/node:18-alpine', but I’m unsure about the location’s validity. Alternatively, there’s a mirror for 'library' that could work. I could also change the base image to 'node:18-bullseye' or 'node:20-alpine' but need to resolve the authentication issue first.
**Addressing Mirror Issues**

I’m encountering challenges with USTC and NetEase mirrors, which sometimes block library access even without requiring login. A good option is to use 'mirror.aliyuncs.com', but it points to 'registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com', which needs authentication for private registries. The public ACR mirrors replicate official images, while the 'library' namespace might not be default. Another mirror, 'docker.m.daocloud.io', appears to work well. I should consider prebuilt Node images from the GitHub Container Registry as an alternative to streamline the process.
**Exploring Docker Solutions**

I’m working with an Alibaba Cloud server and considering a few options to fix some issues. One approach is to pre-pull and load Node images offline. I could also push my own Node base image to my Alibaba Cloud Container Registry, but that requires credentials. A quick fix involves modifying the Dockerfile to set 'ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine' and using a specific npm registry. I could also explore alternative domains like 'dockerproxy.com' or common mirrors, though their reliability can be questionable. Ultimately, using 'ghcr.io' images might be the best route, even if Node official images aren't mirrored there.
**Setting Up Docker Mirrors**

I think the best fix might be to update the Docker 'daemon.json' to include 'registry-mirrors' for 'https://docker.m.daocloud.io' and 'https://hub.uuuadc.top.' Previous attempts with 'registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com' led to 'insufficient_scope' errors, so I'll focus on just the reliable mirrors. To execute commands remotely, we can use SSH to run a series of commands on the user's remote server. I’ll need to check Docker and buildx, modify the '/etc/docker/daemon.json', restart the Docker service, and finally test pulling 'node:18-alpine'.
**Crafting a Plan for Docker Issues**

It looks like we need to tackle some problems with Docker mirrors. If the current mirrors are still blocked, I can switch to 'cgr.dev/chainguard/node:18' or 'bitnami/node:18'. A better approach might involve updating '/etc/docker/daemon.json' to include only functional mirrors like 'docker.m.daocloud.io'. We can execute SSH commands to back up and edit the Docker configuration while also setting up a loop to pull Node images from a list of alternative mirrors. After ensuring the base image is accessible, we can focus on dependency installation using a potential npm registry while deciding whether or not to alter the Dockerfile.
**Setting Up Docker Configuration**

It looks like I need to deal with some placeholder content and focus on setting up Docker mirrors. First, I'll update the Docker configuration with registry mirrors like 'docker.m.daocloud.io' and 'hub.uuuadc.top'. I'll create SSH commands to verify and restart the Docker service, then pre-pull the Node base image, using a robust method to handle potential issues with arrays in the shell. Finally, I’ll proceed to build the app and manage logs, ensuring we capture everything along the way. Let's get started!</details></think>

我先在服务器上配置可用的 Docker 镜像加速源并重启 Docker，以解决拉取 Node 基础镜像超时/鉴权失败的问题。随后会预拉取并本地标记 node:18-alpine，最后在禁用 BuildKit 的情况下进行构建。

方案 1（推荐）：给 Docker 守护进程配置代理（立刻生效）

前提：你手里有一个可用的 HTTP/HTTPS 代理（企业出口代理、跳板机网关、WARP 转 HTTP、或本机 Clash/ sing-box 的 HTTP 端口），假设是
http://127.0.0.1:7890（请替换为你实际的代理地址）。

为 Docker 的 systemd 服务注入代理环境变量

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,registry-1.docker.io,auth.docker.io,index.docker.io,hub.docker.com,*.aliyuncs.com"
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
systemctl show docker -p Environment


若你的代理是 需要鉴权 的，URL 里写成 http://user:pass@host:port 即可。
NO_PROXY 可按需精简/调整；若你的代理能稳定访问 Docker Hub，也可以去掉 registry-1.docker.io 等条目。

再试拉取（先小后大）

docker pull hello-world
docker pull node:18-alpine


构建镜像（建议保留可切换基镜像的构建参数，见下）

cd /root/projects/storyapp
docker compose build --no-cache --build-arg NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine app


如果你没有现成代理，看方案 2。

方案 2：使用阿里云 ACR“专属镜像加速器”+ 代理兜底

很多国内主机只靠镜像站仍会卡在 auth.docker.io，所以最稳是两者一起用：

registry-mirrors 换成 你账号专属的 ACR 加速器域（形如 https://<你的ID>.mirror.aliyuncs.com）

若仍遇到鉴权域直连问题，再叠加方案 1 的代理（二者并不冲突）

修改 /etc/docker/daemon.json（把 <你的ID> 换成 ACR 控制台里给你的专属域名；若暂时没拿到，可先保留 dockerproxy.com 做过渡）：

sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
{
  "registry-mirrors": [
    "https://<你的ID>.mirror.aliyuncs.com",
    "https://dockerproxy.com"
  ],
  "max-concurrent-downloads": 6,
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": { "max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3" }
}
EOF

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker

# 清理可能的错误 token 和缓存
rm -f ~/.docker/config.json || true
docker builder prune -af || true
docker system prune -af --volumes || true

# 验证
docker pull hello-world
docker pull node:18-alpine


仍然超时 ➜ 再叠加方案 1（为 Docker 配置代理）。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating Docker tasks**

I’m currently looking at a todo list with tasks related to configuring Docker, like parametrizing the Dockerfile base image and setting up NPM sources. There’s a shift towards configuring the server-level proxy now, so I’ll update tasks, adding steps for Docker proxy and ACR mirror configurations, and pre-pulling images. I need to ensure we maintain indentation and style in our code edits. The `Dockerfile` is straightforward, so I’ll define `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` to streamline usage in multi-stage builds.
**Understanding Docker ARG behavior**

In Docker, I need to remember that each `FROM` resets the `ARG`, unless it's declared before each `FROM` or globally at the top. The build arguments only carry over if I re-declare them after every `FROM`. So, I’ll define `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` before the first `FROM` and use it accordingly in each stage. If I want to customize the base image tag, I should declare `ARG NODE_IMAGE` at the top and repeat it in subsequent stages. This approach seems to be the safest.
**Configuring NPM registry and Docker**

I’m thinking about setting the NPM registry to a mirror, like npmmirror, during `npm ci` commands. I could either use `npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com` or pass `--registry` directly with `npm ci`. For reproducibility, using a `.npmrc` might help, but I could also set the registry at each builder stage, although that modifies the global config in the container. The user requested building with a specific `NODE_IMAGE`, so I’ll add that support to the compose file and also configure Docker systemd service proxies on the server. Running commands via SSH is the plan, and I suspect the server is running Ubuntu or Alibaba Cloud Linux.
**Configuring systemd and proxy settings**

I realize that systemd is present, and I need to configure `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` with the right environment variables based on the user’s plan. But first, I need to clarify what proxy address is available. The user provided a sample like "假设 http://127.0.0.1:7890", but I know that on a remote server, this would refer to itself only if a local proxy is running. Many servers won't have a local proxy. They mentioned ACR and "dockerproxy.com" too. However, I remember we faced a login issue with "pull access denied" and "insufficient_scope" errors after configuring registry mirrors. This might be due to how the mirror proxies to the hub or authorization token issues. Using a system-level HTTP proxy should help ensure the connection to auth.docker.io works.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing Dockerfile guidelines**

The repo guidelines suggest using step-by-step manual commands, like `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build --no-cache app`, over batch scripts. I need to check the current Dockerfile we reviewed since it doesn't have any `ARG` statements, although the file `old/sfjim.md` mentions adding them. We haven’t parameterized the Dockerfile yet, even though I set it as a todo item. The user is expecting progress, but I'll need to implement code changes for that.
**Implementing Dockerfile changes**

I think we need to make a minimal change to the Dockerfile by using `ARG` for the base image and possibly setting an NPM registry. The guidelines don’t mention customizing the NPM registry, but it could be helpful. I also see that the `docker-compose.yml` currently lacks build args. I could use the CLI for build args without specifying them in compose. The simplest change would be updating the Dockerfile to accept `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` and apply this in the three `FROM` lines for clarity, using multi-stage builds for better structure.
**Clarifying ARG usage in Dockerfile**

I see that when using `ARG` before any `FROM`, it only applies to that first stage. To use it in subsequent stages, I need to redefine `ARG NODE_IMAGE` for each stage. Docker supports this from version 17.05, but each `FROM` referencing it must have the `ARG` defined earlier. I could also duplicate the `ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:18-alpine` for each `FROM`. Additionally, I should consider adding `ARG NPM_REGISTRY` for npm configuration. Is the frontend using CRA? I'll need to verify that.
**Setting up NPM registry in Dockerfile**

In the Dockerfile, I need to consider setting the NPM registry for `npm ci`. I could use `npm config set registry $NPM_REGISTRY`, and to avoid any issues, it's possible to use `ENV npm_config_registry=$NPM_REGISTRY` instead. I think adding an optional `ARG NPM_REGISTRY` with a default value of `https://registry.npmmirror.com` is a good approach, which can benefit users in China. I’ll ensure to use `RUN npm config set registry $NPM_REGISTRY` in both builder contexts and the final stage before running `npm ci`. It's important to keep changes minimal and avoid committing secrets.
**Applying Dockerfile changes**

I'm noticing that in the final stage, they're running `RUN npm install axios`, which feels odd since they already run `npm ci` for runtime dependencies including axios. They might be avoiding bundling issues, but I won’t change that—it’s essential to keep things minimal.

Next, I need to update `docker-compose.yml` to include build args for NODE_IMAGE and NPM_REGISTRY. I'll also propose remote commands to pull images using `mirror.gcr.io`, but first, I’ll implement the necessary changes in the Dockerfile, including `ARG NODE_IMAGE` and ensuring the configuration allows for proper building and installation of dependencies. Lastly, I need to add a micro update near the top when executing commands.
**Updating Dockerfile and Compose**

I'm planning to add the NPM registry to the Dockerfile by including `ARG NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com` after the `WORKDIR /app` line. Setting the registry ensures it applies only to each build stage, so I need to redeclare it in all stages. I'll also update `docker-compose.yml` to include build arguments for each app service. 

For remote commands, I intend to attempt pulling `mirror.gcr.io/library/node:18-alpine` first. If that fails, I can switch to a proxy option. Finally, I’ll ensure I'm checking the appropriate server path during the build process.</details></think>

我将先修改 Dockerfile 以参数化基础镜像和 NPM 源，然后在两个 docker-compose 文件中为构建传递这些参数。接着我会在服务器上优先尝试通过 mirror.gcr.io 预拉取 Node 基础镜像并进行构建与启动。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering proxy implementation**

The file 'old/sfjim.md' seems to include sample credentials, specifically a base64 password string. I need to be cautious and adhere to the instruction of not using real secrets since remote commands are temporary. The user provided a preferred approach (方案 1), customizing Docker systemd with an HTTP_PROXY. They also suggested a backup method (方案 2) for setting up a proxy. Given previous issues with a local proxy, we might need to proceed with the "mirror.gcr.io" method first as Plan A.
**Planning proxy adjustments**

It seems the HTTP_PROXY pointing to 127.0.0.1:7890 is causing issues with mirror.gcr.io. First, I should remove the proxy environment variable from the Docker service by clearing those values. I'll proceed by either deleting or commenting out the http-proxy.conf file, restarting Docker, and then trying to pull `mirror.gcr.io/library/node:18-alpine`. If that fails, I have a fallback plan with registry mirrors like `https://docker.m.daocloud.io`. Alternatively, I could go with Plan 2, which involves using a shadowsocks server with privoxy.
**Assessing subscription and proxy options**

The content in 'sfjim.md' suggests that the user has a subscription, but I don't have the actual YAML details. It mentions "你的订阅里节点是 `ss`" and references a base64 password, which may just be examples. I should ask the user to paste any of the nodes, but my guidance says not to request info if I can find it myself. I can't assume their credentials either. I could propose implementing 'Privoxy only' but need a remote HTTP proxy. The user mentioned a local proxy at 127.0.0.1:7890, which isn't set up. So, I might need to suggest creating an automated script for the options, or removing the incorrect proxy to use a registry mirror like 'dockerproxy.com'.
**Implementing registry mirrors**

I can proceed with "方案 2" by using only 'registry-mirrors' set to 'dockerproxy.com', 'ustc', and 'tencentyun'. First, I need to clean any builder caches and try again. Instead of using `docker pull` with `--registry-mirror`, which isn't supported, a better option is to configure registry mirrors in the `daemon.json` file with the specified links. I'll also clear caches by deleting the config file and using prune commands. Finally, I can try to pull the node image with a fallback option if the first attempt fails.
**Preparing Docker script**

If mirror.gcr is blocked, I think direct Docker Hub might work with mirrors. I plan to build using `docker compose`, specifying a node image. First, I'll remove the proxy setting, as pulling `hello-world` previously succeeded with it, which is a bit odd. I should craft a remote shell script that removes the Docker service proxy and sets the registry mirrors. Then, I'll clean caches, test small images, and finally build and bring up the necessary services.  

I'll make sure to summarize any output and reference documents correctly.</details></think>

我先移除服务器上为 Docker 配置的错误代理（127.0.0.1:7890 不存在），改为启用国内 registry-mirrors，并清理缓存后重试拉取与构建。随后我会启动容器并查看日志。
